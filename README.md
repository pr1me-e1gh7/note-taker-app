# note-taker-app
## 👨‍💻 Mission
An application to save and take notes
## 🌐 Application
<a href="https://dc-note-taker-app.herokuapp.com/">Link to the App</a>

## 💻 User Experience
When the user loads the page they'll be presented with the landing page. When the user clicks on the Get Started button on the landing page, they are taken to the note application. On the note application, the user can add new notes by entering a note title and text below, then clicking the save button at the top-right corner of the window. Their note will save to local storage, clear the title and text forms for a new note, and display the saved note on the right sidebar, where they can click on the note to load it from storage or click the trash icon to delete it from storage. Should the user click on a saved note in the sidebar, they may click the plus icon at the top-right of the window to start a new note.
